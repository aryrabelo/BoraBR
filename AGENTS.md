# Agent Instructions

This project uses **br** as the primary issue tracker (beads_rust). Use **bd** only when `br` is unavailable.

## Quick Reference

```bash
br onboard           # Initialize local issue tracker integration
br ready              # Find available work
br show <id>          # View issue details
br update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
br close <id>         # Complete work
br sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

### Mandatory workflow

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Push to remote** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

## Critical rules

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
